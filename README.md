# Floodâ€‘aware Road Risk & Safe Routing

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based solution for assessing flood risks on roads and providing safer routing options. The goal is to use flood risk data, historical traffic data, and geospatial analytics to identify flood-prone areas and recommend safe alternate routes for road users, reducing potential hazards during flood events.

## Project Overview

Flooding is a significant risk to road infrastructure, and it often causes delays, damage, or even accidents. By using a combination of flood prediction models, historical traffic data, geospatial information, and machine learning algorithms, this project helps in:

- **Predicting flood-prone road sections.**
- **Determining the risk level of roads during rainfall events.**
- **Providing alternative routes to avoid flooded roads.**
- **Visualizing flood risk zones and safe routes on maps.**

## Features

- Flood risk prediction using machine learning models.
- Geospatial visualization of flood zones and alternative routes.
- Integration with OpenStreetMap data for routing and map generation.
